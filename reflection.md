I consulted with Katie Wilson several times while working on this week's assignment, and we worked on the program alongside each other on our seperate files. We had different approaches but discussed the structure of the program and how to manage the problems we both were facing. I also talked with Kathleen, who talked me through her approach to changing out the mirror words which was insightful. I attended the TA session on Sunday from 1-3 with TA Dakota, as well as the session from 7-9 with the same TA. Dakota guided me towards using a for loop, which I had attempted but was failing. I tinkered with it some more and eventually was able to piece everything together.

Having only worked in Python before, Java feels familiar but a little more confusing to manage, especially as the program gets longer. I found some tasks to be more straightforward than Python but overall not quite as intuitive, usually requiring extra steps. Not being able to use lists the way I can in Python was a bit frustrating for me while working on this assignment, and in general having these "steps" I wanted to execute without knowing the Java syntax to do so. It felt like I knew what I wanted to "say" but didn't know how to do so in Java. It was also a hindrance when I kept making simple syntax error mistakes and other errors, which helped me to practice using all of the braces needed for Java, and get used to the other syntax differences between Java and Python.

Now that I am able to compare Java and Python, one of the commonalities I see is the importance of storing and passing along information correctly and efficiently, which I think can be applied to programming in general.

About halfway through I was finding that I really wanted to use a dictionary as part of the program to identify mirror words as keys and replace them with their corresponding value, but I couldn't quite get this to work, so this may be something I revisit. I later found out about two dimensional arrays amidst researching Java syntax, so that could be a solution to try when revising this program. As it is, though, I could not get this idea to work so I scrapped it and opted for the clunky solution that is currently used in my program.
What did work was using arrays and ar
