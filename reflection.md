I consulted with Katie Wilson several times while working on this week's assignment, and we worked on the program alongside each other on our seperate files. We had different approaches but discussed the structure of the program and how to manage the problems we both were facing. I also talked with Kathleen, who talked me through her approach to changing out the mirror words which was insightful. 
I attended the TA session on Sunday from 1-3 with TA Dakota, as well as the session from 7-9 with the same TA. Dakota talked to me about using a for loop for the words in the array of input. I tinkered with it some more and eventually was able to piece everything together.

Having only worked in Python before, Java feels familiar but a little more confusing to manage, especially as the program gets longer. I found some tasks to be more straightforward than Python but overall not quite as intuitive, usually requiring extra steps. Not being able to use lists the way I can in Python was a bit frustrating for me while working on this assignment, and in general having these "steps" I wanted to execute without knowing the Java syntax to do so. It felt like I knew what I wanted to "say" but didn't know how to do so in Java. It was also a hindrance when I kept making simple syntax error mistakes and other errors, which did help me to practice using all of the braces needed for Java, and get used to the other syntax differences between Java and Python.

Now that I am able to compare Java and Python, one of the commonalities I see is the importance of storing and passing along information correctly and efficiently, which I think can be applied to programming in general.

What I was not able to get working was a straightforward way to distinguish when to use a canned response versus when to create a mirror response.
About halfway through I was finding that I really wanted to use the equivalent of a python dictionary as part of the program to identify mirror words as keys and replace them with their corresponding value, but I couldn't quite get this to work, so this may be something I revisit. I later found out about two dimensional arrays amidst researching Java syntax, so that could be a solution to try when revising this program. As it is, though, I could not get this idea to work so I scrapped it and opted for the clunky solution that is currently used in my program. The unwieldy, long conditional at line 43 is sort of a placeholder solution because I was not able to figure out how to make other approaches work.
What I was able to do was use randomization to generate a different canned response each time.
I would reccomend any student working on this assignment to write out just a few of the mirror words to test first, like I to you, and once you can get that working, you can type out the rest of the mirror words without having to go back and change them all if it turns out that the code you copied for each word wasn't quite right.
