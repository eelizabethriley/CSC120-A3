I consulted with Katie Wilson several times while working on this week's assignment, and we worked on the program alongside each other on our seperate files. We had slightly different approaches but discussed the structure of the program and how to manage the problems we both were facing. I also talked with Kathleen while at TA hours, who talked me through her appraoch to changing out the mirror words which was insightful. I attended the TA session on Sunday from 1-3 with TA Dakota, as well as the session from 7-9.

Having only worked in Python before, my initial impressions in Java are that it is familiar but a little more confusing to manage, especially as the program gets longer. I found some tasks to be more straightforward than Python but overall not quite as intuitive, usually requiring extra steps. Not being able to use lists the way I can in Python was especially frustrating for me while working on this assignment. It felt like I knew what steps I wanted to take but didn't know how to do so in Java. It was also a hindrance when I kept making simple syntax error mistakes and other errors.
